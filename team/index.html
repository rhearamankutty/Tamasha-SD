Along with her aspirations to become an optometrist, Yasmin hopes to positively impact her community; primarily, through her volunteer work in underprivileged vision care clinics. She is also a Pre-Health Professions Peer Mentor as well as a member of FOCUS (Pre-Optometry club). Yasmin enjoys horror/psychological thrilling movies, all flavors of ice cream, and scrolling through Twitter. She has also served on board as VP External as well as Outreach Chair.

				<figure title="SAMHITA PALAKODETI, PRESIDENT" description="Samhita is a 4th year majoring in Human Biology at UCSD. She was born and raised in San Diego, and absolutely loves it here! She was the VP Internal for TamashaSD last year and is also Social Chair for SangamSD and Media Manager for MedICamp. Her favorite color is periwinkle and her spirit animal is probably a cat, even though she's allergic to them. Samhita joined the TamashaSD board because of her passion for dance and her love for organizing events. Her favorite pastime is eating acai bowls, but when she's not doing that, you can catch her thinking about eating an acai bowl (well, either that or eating ice cream depending on how healthy she's trying to be that day)."

Mitthi’s hobbies include designing rooms on RoomSketcher, buying everything at Trader Joes (which she insists on calling TJoes), and experiencing the madness."

Aasna loves working with kids and had spent much of her time volunteering and taking care of the youth and elderly in the past. She has been passionate about dance all her life and even joined the bollywood dance team on campus, UCSD Zor during her freshman year. Aasna is a part of different premed clubs on campus and works at the VA at a neuropsychiatry lab studying PTSD this year. After being part of a close knit Indian circuit in the bay and the past three years through Zor and Tamasha, she can't wait to bring forth more ideas and unique events to gather the community in SD this year! Experience the madness as she works with the rest of the board to make year 4 even better than the last!"

Sweta loves hiking, traveling, binge watching the same TV shows, and THAI FOOD!! She joined Tamasha because of her love for dance and to stay connected to her Indian roots.
